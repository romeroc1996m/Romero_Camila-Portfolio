        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>DSRL camera skills were tauht during the term, because of this students were requeried to take photos with aperture and shutter speed mode according to their choosen topic.</p>

        <h2>Solution</h2>
            <p>Students were requested to take photos of an accessible environment. I chose a popular and spontaneous environment as it is for street photography, most likely focusing on architecture. One addtional task was assign to improve the shooting, photos should be edited in photoshop or lightroom, through color correction, croping, and resizing. </p>
